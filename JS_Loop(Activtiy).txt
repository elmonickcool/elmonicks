//1. Write a function that outputs all even numbers from 0 to 100 using a for loop.

let x=0;

function even(){
    for(x;x<=100;x++){
        if(x % 2 == 0){
            console.log(x)
        }
    }
    
}
even();

//2. Write a function that adds all odd numbers from 20 to 80 and returns the result.

let x=20;
let y=0;

function odd(){
    for (x;x<=80;x++){
        if(x % 2 == 1){
           y+=x;
        }
    }
    console.log(y)
}
odd();

//3.  Write a function that outputs the following pattern using a for loop.

let x=0;

function repeat(){
    for(x;x<5;x++){
        for(x;x<5;x++){
            console.log(x)
        }
    }
}
repeat();


4. Write a function that outputs the following pattern, using a for loop.

*

**

***

****

*****

 

5. Write a function that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").

 

6. Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total) based from your code in Number 5.

 

7. Write a function checkPalindrome() that will output if a given number is a palindrome or not. A palindromic number is the same number that is read forward and backwards.

 

8. Write a function reverseNumber() that will print a given number in reverse.

Ex.

Given = 129

Output should be:

9

2

1

 

9. Write a function fibonacciSeries() that will accept a number and generate the Fibonacci series for that number.

Ex. 

Given = 7

Fibonacci series is: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21

 

10. Write a function that will display all days in 3 weeks.

Ex.

Week: 1

Day: 1

Day: 2

Day: 3

Day: 4

Day: 5

Day: 6

Day: 7

Week: 2
